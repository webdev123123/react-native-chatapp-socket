# React Native Chat App With Socket

> Clean and minimalist React Native template for a quick start with Chat Applications with TypeScript.

## :star: Features

- Chat with users as real-time
- See last seen status of the user
- Take custom drop-down alert when message received

## :arrow_forward: Usage

### Note on the legacy CLI
There seems to be quite some confusion about the legacy CLI. This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`), for the below command to work. If you wish to not use `npx`, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).
